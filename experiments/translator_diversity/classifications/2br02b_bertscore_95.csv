218,He thought of starvation.,1
219,He knew that he would never paint again.,0
220,He let his paintbrush fall to the drop-cloths below.,1
221,"And then he decided he had had about enough of life in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he came slowly down from the ladder.",1
222,"He took Wehling's pistol, really intending to shoot himself.",1
223,But he didn't have the nerve.,1

226,"""Federal Bureau of Termination,"" said the very warm voice of a hostess.",1
